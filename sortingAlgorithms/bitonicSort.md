# Bitonic Sorting

A bitonic sequence is a sequence that is first increasing then decreasing

A data set is bitonic if there exist an index i for which all elements less than or equal to i are in increasing order and all elements greater than or equal to i are in decreasing order.

> a list which is entirely increasing or entirely decreasing can also be said to be bitonic with the other half as being empty.
