# Quick Sort
Quick sort is an efficieint, in-place, divide-and-conquer algorithm which sort elements by partitioning the data sets into two parts. Then recursively sorting each parts independently.

> to partition the  data sets we use a pivot

Time Complexity:

best case - O(n.logn), worst case (O(n^2))

Space Complexity:

best case (O(logn)), worst case (O{n})


> Best case fro tiem complexity happens when partitioning is done in the center, worst case time complexity happens when partitioning is done in the begining or end

### Implementation
