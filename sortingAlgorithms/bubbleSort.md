# Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple, in-place, stable sorting algorithm which repeatedly swaps elements that are out of order until the list is sorted.

> By stable, it means that Bubble sort retain the order of duplicate element in the array to be sorted

>By in-place, it means no new array is created, the sorting is done on the unsorted array.

Time complexity: O(n^2)
Space complexity: O(1)
