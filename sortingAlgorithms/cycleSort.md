# Cycle Sort

Cycle sort is an unstable, in-place, comparison-based sorting algorithm which sorts the list using a set of cycles. Each cycle consists of placing an element at it's sorted index in the data-set, taking the element at the sorted index and placing it at it's sorted index, and repeating until the list is sorted
